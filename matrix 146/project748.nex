Several chondrichthyans and certain placoderms including ptyctodontids and phyllolepids exhibit this condition.

Contra Brazeau, Acanthodes seems to bear cheek scales, but we acknowledge that the condition of this character is extremely variable and could be adjusted in future anlyses ?. In cases of genera such as Obtusacanthus and Kathemacanthus where cheeks are incompleteley known, we score both as state "''0"''. Obtusacanthus, specimen UALVP 41488, has a large area of the central region of the right side cheek, missing. However, the entire rim of this missing region is scaled, and bases of scales from the opposite side ? are visible. These show that the missing region was scale-covered ?.

This identifies the slender rays extending from the lower half of the Acanthodes hyoid arch ? as homologues of the osteichthyan branchiostegal series, as well as the hyoidean gill-cover plates of several, but not all, acanthodian clades ?. Such rays would therefore be part of the dermal skeleton. Alternatively, the Acanthodes hyoid rays can be homologized with those of modern and fossil chondrichthyans ?. In this instance, these structures would be part of the endoskeleton, and Acanthodes must be coded as state "''0"''.^n		Both hypotheses are consistent with the proximity of these rays to the hyoid arch in specimens such as HU MB 11a ?. Of the usual criteria used for estimating morphological homology ?, only overall shape similarity is available to assist choice between these alternative hypotheses. Likely close relatives of Acanthodes such as Homalacanthus ? show slightly more plate-shaped rays, and this could be used as an additional line of evidence to justify coding these rays in Acanthodes as state "''1"''. However, this decision includes an additional, implicit, hypothesis of phylogeny and character polarity. Here, the alternative coding is used: state "''0"'' for Acanthodes, based upon morphological similarity ?. This is consistent with the aim of leaving the analysis open to discovering patterns of character evolution ?. But, we acknowledged that the apparent objectivity of such a position is questionable ?.^n';

Examples of imbricating plates are seen clearly in early osteichthyans such as Mimia ?. In acanthodian examples such as Cassidiceps ? the branchiostegal plates overlap in the region directly caudal to the level of the jaw joint. In Gladiobranchus ?, examples of the plates ventral to the mandible are similarly overlapped. It is also noteworthy that the proximal end of each plate is slightly curved, dorsally. In Mesacanthus ?, the proximal ends of members of the branchiostegal series are curved towards adjacent plates. However, the long margins of each plate are free, and bordered only by areas of matrix or scales: these rays are separated. Any imbrication between such plates, at the most proximal end, is uncertain. Brazeau"''s discussion of this character might cover two conditions of the branchiostegals: overlap ? and proximal curvature. Here, we code only for plate overlap, and score Mesacanthus as "''0"''.';

	TEXT CHARACTER=129 TEXT='Davis ?; Hanke & Wilson ?; Brazeau ?. Davis ? notes that spines with a shallow insertion appear to characterize a clade encompassing acanthodians traditionally grouped as climatiids. However, spines with shallow insertions are also known among early chondrichthyans, of which Antarctilamna ? is a notable example. Alternatively, Hanke & Wilson ? suggest that Antarctilamna spines with shallow insertions are probably associated with the paired fins, as in Doliodus ?. Despite this apparently straightforward distinction between character states, some acanthodians, such as Obtusacanthus ?, remain difficult to assign ?. The median fin spine of Psarolepis remains, as far as we are aware, known only from disarticulated remains. However, surface morphology of the attributed spine indicates no more than a shallow insertion ?.';
	TEXT CHARACTER=130 TEXT='Davis ?; Hanke & Wilson ?; Brazeau ?. For present purposes, ptyctodontids are coded as uncertain. However, as noted by Miles & Young ?, in both sexes of Rhamphodopsis a small, paired elongate plate is positioned transversely in front of each pelvic fin. Similar structures known in other ptyctodontids have often been identified as pre-pelvic claspers; these could be interpreted more straightforwardly as pre-pelvic or intermediate fin spines.';

Undiscussed in previous analyses, this character appears in Hanke and Wilson"''s ? study as nodes rounded and elevated ?, or flattened ?. Here, and in Brazeau"''s ? study, the character is used to encompass the ornamentation of those fin spines in which arrangements of nodes ? are born on the finspine surface, usually along the apex of ridges or aligned to form such ridges. We argue that this kind of ornament, exemplified clearly in taxa such as Lupopsyrus ?, is also present on the fin spines of many early chondrichthyans, such as ctenacanths ? and Tamiobatis ?. ';
