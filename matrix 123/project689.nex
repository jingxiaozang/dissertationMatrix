	TEXT CHARACTER=20 TEXT='Perez-Losada char 12^nOccurrence of rostrolaterals in the wall of shell plates. We must express considerable doubt regarding the traditional homology scheme when comparing lateral plates in scalpelloids and verrucomorphs with those in balanomorphs. Cirripedologists generally agree that a scalpelloid such as Pollicz$es possess both CL, L, and RL ?. However, our Figure 1A clearly illustrates that the plates bearing these names may often deviate little, if at all, in special morphology and size from the remaining and largely anonymous imbricating plates. Thus the homology seems based principally on the criterion of position, although assisted by some evidence from ontogeny and comparison to OTUs such as Neolepas. Proverrucu ? and Eocerrucu Jr possess two large plates in a lateral position, which the traditional interpretation ? considers as CL and RL. However, this has come to seem doubtful since the putatively more plesiomorphic member of the verrucomorph clade, Neoverruca, has a median latus ? but no dedicated carinolatera ? or rostrolatera ?. We do not want to build our interpretations on preconceived ideas of phylogeny, so we examined the possible homologies between the lateral plates in Proverrucu ? and Eoverruca ? and those in either balanomorphs or scalpelloids. This reveals^nthat we cannot reject the possibility that the plate overlapping the rostrum ? in Prouerruca? and Eoverrucap may, positionally, be an RL, but it cannot be an L. We therefore code these two OTUs as 13?. The other plate, however, overlapped by the one just mentioned and itself overlapping the carina, could either be an L or a CL. We therefore code Proverruca? and Eoverrucut as 12?; ?.';

	TEXT CHARACTER=40 TEXT='Wills 10^nIn trilobites, the cephalic exoskeleton is continued on the ventral side of the animal as a reflexed rim or doublure of variable width. In many trilobites this is a broad band extending a considerable distance adaxially. A similar reflexion occurs beneath the pygidium. The anterior doublure is usually mared by terrace lines running subparallel to the margin of the cephalon. A soft, ventral membrane was attached to the inner edge of the reflexed margin in life and ran to the bases of the appendages. A number of arachnomorph taxa show similar development of the marginal cephalic shield. A small number of crustacean genera have reflexed carapace margins, notably the cephalocarids and remipedes, taxa regarded by Hessler ? and Schram ? as particularly primitive. The ventral carapace of stomatopods and some decapods projects medially to meet an epistomal plate lying between the bases ofthe antennae and the mandibles. The head capsules of "atelocerates" lack any dorsoventral division, and the simple continuation of the dorsal cuticle beneath the head is not considered homologous with the doublure. A form of reflexion does occur along the trunk of some Thysanura, where the dorsal tergites double back along a considerable portion of their length before joining with the bases of the thoracic appendages ?.
