        	TEXT CHARACTER=1 TEXT='Description from Strait et al., ?: ^n"Hominids vary in the pattern by which the nasal bones project above the frontomaxillary suture ?. Four states are recognized: ? nasal bones extend superior to the frontomaxillary suture by means of a narrow projection ?; ? nasal bones project above the frontomaxillary suture, widening laterally as they pass the suture line; ? nasal bones do not project above the frontomaxillary suture; and ? variable. The final state is observed in A. africanus. The nasals project and are expanded in Taung but they project and are superiorly tapered in Stw 505 and Sts 5. Whereas Olson ? suggested that the nasal bones do not project in Sts 5, Broom & Robinson ? have noted that they do in fact project above the suture. Pan and Gorilla are coded as having nasals that project and taper. Although Eckhardt ? observed morphological variants in 8% of ape crania, the dominant pattern in both genera is state 0. Our own observations confirm this. This character is treated as unordered because there seems to be an equal probability of deriving each state from any other. ^nThis character combines S&M 1 ? and S&M 2 ?. When nasion approaches glabella, the nasal bones project, but it is necessary to combine S&M 1 and S&M 2 because it is uncertain whether projecting nasal bones are homologous when the manner in which they project differs ?. Furthermore, the frontomaxillary suture is a better reference point than glabella for assessing nasal bone projection because nasion may approach glabella because of either the superior movement of nasion or the inferior migration of glabella ?."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=2 TEXT='Description from Strait et al., ?: ^n"Olson ? describes the morphology of the inferior margin of the orbit as being either rounded laterally or not rounded. Rounded lateral margins are present in A. aethiopicus and A. robustus. They are also present in a large proportion of male G. gorilla, and thus this species is coded as being variable. This character is equivalent to S&M 3."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=3 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"This character is equivalent to S&M 4. However, the character is here quantified as a ratio of the distances between orbitale and the foramen, and orbitale and the root of the zygoma. A high foramen has a value of 0.5 ?. State assignments produced by this ratio corespond to those of S&M 4 except with respect to A. africanus. This is because Sts 52a possesses a low foramen whereas the foramina in all other A. africanus specimens are high. Accordingly, A. africanus is here coded as being variable. Although Skelton & McHenry ? noted that Sts 52a has a low foramen, they coded the species as "high". "^n^nModifications made by Strait and Grine ?: ^n"KGA 10-525 has a high infraorbital foramen ?, whereas all other P. boisei crania have an infraorbital foramen that pierces the lower half of the chord measured between orbitale and the root of the zygoma. Thus, this species is considered variable."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=4 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"This character is equivalent to S&M 6, but state assignments here differ considerably from theirs. Skelton & McHenry ? followed Rak ? in accepting that pillars in A. boisei ? had been "obscured by infilling". This state assignment is based on a functional interpretation of australopithecine facial evolution ?, rather than upon strict observation. Consequently, pillars are considered to be absent in A. boisei and A. aethiopicus. Furthermore, pillars are variable in A. africanus rather than present ? because they are absent in Sts 52a but present in all other relevant specimens. Finally, contrary to S&M 6, pillars are considered to be variable in H. habilis ?, and absent in H. rudolfensis ?."^n^n^nModifications made by Strait and Grine ?: ^n"Keyser ? described the Drimolen skull as lacking anterior pillars. However, in the text of the paper, he ? stated that "Weakly developed anterior pillars are barely visible." Moreover, he noted that the margins of the nasal aperture are rounded. Thus, we interpret this specimen as having anterior pillars, albeit ones that are weak."^n';
	TEXT CHARACTER=5 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"This character is equivalent to S&M 12. Rak ? describes three forms of the nasoalveolar clivus: convex, straight, and concave ?. In our definition, "straight" includes both slight concavity and slight convexity. Skelton & McHenry ? considered the clivus of A. aethiopicus ? to be more concave than that in A. robustus and A. boisei. All three of these species are coded here as being concave. Furthermore ?, H. habilis possesses a straight clivus."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=6 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"When the nasoalveolar contour protrudes, the incisors are anterior to the canines, and when there is no protrusion, the incisors are in the same coronal plane as the canines. Skelton & McHenry ? stated that Stw 73 lacks protrusion, and thus coded A. africanus as variable. We disagree with this assessment, and consider protrusion to be present in this and all other A. africanus specimens." ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=7 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"This character seems to be equivalent to S&M 10 ?. McCollum et al. ? described differences in the form of the entrance to the nasal cavity in fossil hominids. A stepped entrance ? is one in which there is a drop posterior to the nasoalveolar clivus. A smooth entrance is one in which the clivus grades into the nasal floor. However, a smooth entrance can be formed in two ? ways. In H. sapiens, the smooth entrance is formed by flexions in the clivus and hard palate, which do not overlap ?. In other hominid species that exhibit a smooth entrance, the clivus and palate ovelap considerably ?. State assignments follow McCollum et al. ?, who differ from Skelton & McHenry ? regarding A. africanus, A. robustus, and A. boisei. McCollum et al. ? also differ from Walker et al. ?, who characterized A. africanus as being intermediate. Furthermore, McCollum et al. ? characterized KNM-ER 1805 as having a smooth nasal cavity entrance, whereas Skelton and McHenry ? stated that it is stepped. According to McCollum et al. ?, H. habilis is variable ?."^n^nModifications made by Strait and Grine ?: ^n"This character refers to both the contour of the nasal cavity entrance and the degree to which the nasoalveolar clivus and palatine processes overlap. Strait et al. ? obtained their states for this character from McCollum et al. ?. McCollum subsequently updated her characterizations of certain early hominid specimens ?, and morphological groupings proposed by her are largely adopted here. Note that McCollum ? also recognized a distinction between Pan and Gorilla regarding the magnitude of vertical relief between the premaxilla and maxillary palatine processes. This distinction is not recognized here because of the possibility that the difference is a scaling phenomenon."^n^nModification by Mongle, Strait, and Grine: ^nSG7 ? is now coded as variable ? for Au. afarensis based on figure 5.22 in Kimbel et al. ? which depicts AL 442-1 as stepped with no overlap. We also note that Haile-Selassie et al. ? describe 442-1 as stepped with no overlap. This state was previously stepped with overlap ?. This is a new state for SG7. ';
	TEXT CHARACTER=8 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"McCollum et al. ? recorded palatal thickness posterior to the incisive fossa for a variety of extant and extinct hominoids.

	TEXT CHARACTER=9 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"Kimbel et al. ? measured this character as an index of zygomaticoalveolar height relative to orbitoalveolar height. With the exception of OH 5, all specimens of A. africanus, A. robustus and A. boisei had index values in excess of 56.4. All specimens of A. afarensis, H. habilis, H. rudolfensis and H. sapiens fall below 56.6. All Pan specimens were found to fall below 60, as did all but one Gorilla specimen ?. Excluding the single Gorilla outlier, the range for that species is 42.2-58.5. Thus, two states are recognized with slightly overlapping ranges: state 0, a high masseter origin, with an index value in excess of 56, and state 1, a low origin, with an index value below 60. OH 5 has an index value of 47.9. Kimbel et al. ? attribute this to its extraordinary facial height, and thus still consider A. boisei to have a high masseter origin.^nThis character is redundant with S&M 15 ?. This feature was first described by Rak ?, but Kimbel et al. ? poined out that the form of the crest is a necessary correlate of masseter height, and they ? recognized these features as a single character."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=10 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"Two states are recognized: ? thin, with a thickness of less than 8 mm; and ? thick ?. Zygomatic thickness does not simply reflect body size, because the zygomae are thin in both male and female Gorilla.^nThis character replaces S&M 13 ?. Robusticity is usually measured as an index of breadth to height, but this did not reveal any clear taxonomic groupings among fossil hominids or African apes."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=11 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"This character describes the "dishing" of the face and is equivalent to S&M 16, although they did not indicate the point of reference for their characterizations. By using the piriform aperture as a reference, three distinct morphologies are recognized: the infra-orbial plate of the zygoma is posterior to the aperture ?, the zygoma is at the level of the aperture ?, and the zygoma is anterior to the aperture. State 3 is equivalent to having a dished face. A. africanus is variable ? because Sts 71 exhibits the intermediate morphology ?, whereas all other specimens of that species have posteriorly positioned zygomatics."^n^nModifications by Mongle, Strait, and Grine: ^n"Following examination of the DNH 7 cranium, we revise two character states for Paranthropus robustus. Although the height of the masseter origin ? had been coded before as high ? for P. robustus, the masseter origin is low in DNH 7. Therefore, P. robustus is now coded as exhibiting state 1 ? in this character. The anterior projection of the zygomatic bone relative to the piriform aperture ? in DNH 7 also requires a change to the state coded by Strait and Grine ?. While P. robustus was considered dished in prior analyses ?, we now regard DNH 7 to exhibit more intermediate zygomatic morphology. As such, P. robustus is coded as a new variable state ?."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=12 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"This character is equivalent to S&M 43. Two morphologies are recognized: shallow, in which the palate grades posteriorly from the base of the incisors as a flat surface or in which there is a slight depression anterior to the incisive foramen ?, and deep ?, in which the palate rises sharply vertically before turning posteriorly at the incisive foramen ?. H. habilis is variable ?. S&M 43 considered both of these taxa to be deep. A preponderance of humans have deep palates ?."^n^n^nModifications made by Strait and Grine ?: ^nThe palates of KGA 10-525 and KGA 10-506 are shallow anteriorly ?, whereas all other P. boisei crania possess an anteriorly deep palate. Thus, this species is considered variable."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=13 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"Rak ? used this measurement to describe the proportion of the palate that is found anterior to sellion.

Two states are recognized: ? the tubercle is at or posterior to sellion ?, and ? it is at or anterior to sellion ?. The ranges of these two states overlap partially.^nThis character is not redundant with character 11 ?, since the former describes the placement of a muscle attachment whereas the latter describes a bony structure. However, S&M 45 ? and S&M 47 ? are measurements developed by Rak ? that incorporate the same information presented in this character and character 13 ?. Consequently, S&M 45 and 47 are not used."^n^n^nModification by Mongle, Strait, and Grine: ^n ? is now coded as variable ? for Au. africanus based on: Sts 5 is slightly anterior ?, Sts 71 is well anterior, and Sts 52 is posterior.

	TEXT CHARACTER=16 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"The cube root of cranial capacity was used so as to counteract the exponential growth of this volume in relation to the linear dimensions of the braincase. However, equivalent groupings were found using the volumetric measurement, and this is presented here because readers are more familiar with the manner in which this measurement is distributed in hominids. Five states are recognized ?, some of which overlap considerably: ? below 500 cm3, ? approximately 500 cm3, ? 509-680 cm3, ? 750-875 cm3, ? approximately 1400 cm3. State 0 includes P. troglodytes, G. gorilla, A. afarensis and A. aethiopicus. Although some gorillas may exceed 500 cm3, their body sizes are also much greater, and thus their brains are relatively quite small. State 1 includes A. africanus, A. robustus, and A. boisei. Stw 505 has considerably extended the range of A. africanus ?. State 2 includes H. habilis. Although the range of H. habilis overlaps considerably with those of australopithecines, the smallest H. habilis cranial capacity ? is still much larger than the smallest representatives of the australopithecine species. Holloway ? estimated the cranial capacity of Sts 19 to be 436 cm3, but reconstructions that include the calotte Sts 58 indicate cranial capacities between 530 and 570 cm3 ?. State 3 includes H. rudolfensis and H. ergaster. State 4 includes H. sapiens. In general, S&M 65 recognized finer distinctions between taxa than are recognized here."^n^n^nModifications made by Strait and Grine ?: ^n"The state assignments of several early hominid taxa have been revised from Strait et al. ?. Recent discoveries have made clear that the australopith species overlap extensively with re- spect to brain size. Regarding Pr. afarensis, A.L. 444-2 has an estimated capacity of 500 cc ?, which increases the range of this species. With reference to P. boisei, we include here Holloway''""?s ? rough estimate of 395 cc for KNM-WT 17400, which is notably smaller than the values for other P. boisei specimens. The range for this species sample has been extended also by Suwa et al. ?, who provided an estimate of 545 cc for KGA 10-525. We have excluded KNM-ER 3733 from the H. ergaster sample because its published estimate is a minimum value, and we have utilized the "age corrected" value of 909 cc provided for KNM-WT 15000 ?. Although not formally considered here, the specimens from Dmanisi that are likely to be conspecific with the African H. ergaster sample suggest that the range in brain size in this species extends below the size observed in the Nariokotome specimen. The ranges of the non-Homo samples overlap extensively, and they overlap with the ranges for the African ape samples. Because there is no clear distinction among these various species, they are all provided with the same character state."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=17 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"Holloway ? stated that in Homo, A. boisei and A. robustus, the cerebellum is tucked underneath the cerebrum. In most other hominids, the cerebellum flares laterally and protrudes posteriorly. Holloway did not discuss A. afarensis, but our observations suggest that it too flares laterally with posterior protrusion. This character is equivalent to S&M 66."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=18 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"Although Kimbel ? argued that this character is sufficiently variable in humans to preclude its use in phylogenetic studies, it nonetheless appears to discriminate between hominid taxa. An O-M sinus is present either uni- or bilaterally in high frequency ? in A. afarensis, A. boisei, and A. robustus ?. It is absent or found in low frequency ? in African apes ?, H. habilis ?, H. rudolfensis ?. It is absent in the juvenile A. aethiopicus L. 338 y-6 ?, and while Walker et al. ? inferred that it is present in KNM-WT 17000 because of a reduced transverse sinus, Holloway ? has disputed this. An O-M sinus is present in 25% of A. africanus specimens. It is absent in MLD 37/38 ?, MLD 1, Sts 5, Sts 26, TM 1511, and Sts 71 ?, and present in Taung ? and one Stw specimen ?.

	TEXT CHARACTER=19 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"This character, as defined by Kimbel ?, describes the course of the superior temporal line between frontomalaretemporale and the point of maximum inflection on the line as it turns from being medially directed to posteriorly directed. Incursion is best seen in superior view. Incursion is strong in the "robust" australopithecines, where the temporal line penetrates far medially and is parallel to the orbital margin. Incursion is weak in H. ergaster, H. rudolfensis and H. sapiens, where the line barely penetrates medially and is strongly oblique to the orbital margin. H. habilis is variable, because incursion is weak in OH 24 and KNM-ER 1813, but moderate in SK 847 and Stw 53. Data for A. afarensis comes from KNM-ER 2602 and the Belohdeli frontal ?.^nIncursion is related to, but not entirely redundant with the presence/absence of a sagittal crest ?. For example, both G. gorilla and "robust" australopithecines have a sagittal crest, but these taxa differ in their degree of incursion. However, S&M 69 ? and S&M 70 ? are redundant with this character. With respect to S&M 69, Clarke ? describes the supraorbital tori of Pongo, A. boisei and A. robustus as "rib-like" because they are flattened superiorly and have a sharp posterior margin. He notes, however, that the development of the rib is related to postorbital constriction ? and the incursion of the temporal lines, both of which are used here. S&M 70 ? is also redundant with incursion and the presence/absence of a sagittal crest."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=20 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"A sagittal crest is present in KNM-ER 1805 and Stw 505 ?.

	TEXT CHARACTER=21 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"Following Kimbel ?, three states are recognized: ? an extensive crest extending almost the entire distance between inion and the lateral margin of the supramastoid crest, ? a partial crest confined to the lateral third of the bi-asterioric breadth, and ? a crest is absent. A. robustus is coded as missing data for this character. Although Robinson ? reported that crests were absent in SK 48, SK 49 and SK 83, the nuchal region is missing in SK 48 and SK 83, and SK 49 is not a definitive male. Even though crests are absent in SK 47, this specimen is a juvenile, and may not be ontogenetically old enough to exhibit a crest. The H. habilis state assignment is based on KNM-ER 1805.^nS&M 72 ? is rejected because it represents an interpretation of morphology rather than an observation, and because that interpretation is based on patterns of cranial cresting, which have already been accepted as characters in this analysis. Thus, S&M 72 is redundant with this character and character 20 ?. For instance, a sagittal crest combined with a partial temporal nuchal crest would indicate a large anterior temporalis."^n^n^nModifications made by Strait and Grine ?: ^n"It appears that KGA 10-525 possesses an extensive temporonuchal ? crest that runs nearly from inion to the lateral margin of the supramastoid crest ?. An extensive crest is lacking in other presumptive male P. boisei crania. Paranthropus boisei is therefore recognized as being variable in this character."';

H. habilis is correspondingly coded as being variable. Skelton & McHenry ? noted the condition of KNM-ER 1805, but considered a notch to be absent in Homo. Walker et al. ? and Kimbel et al. ? state that a notch is probably present in KNM-WT 17000. Although a notch is absent in L. 338 y-6, a putative juvenile A. aethiopicus, Kimbel & Rak ? note that the character is absent in juvenile apes. All other taxa lack an asterionic notch."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=23 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"Kimbel & Rak ? describe a morphology present in male A. boisei in which the external tables of the temporal, parietal and occipital bones overlap in a complex "sandwich" pattern at asterion. This pattern is also present in KNM-WT 17000 ?, and incipiently in L. 338 y-6. S&M 73 describes this character as "temporoparietal overlap of occipital". The name is shortened here to "parietal overlap of occipital" because the relationship between the temporal and parietal bones is subsumed within character 24 ?. Thus, this character refers only to the flange of parietal bone that extends posteroinferiorly over the occipital."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=24 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"This character refers in particular to the superior and posterosuperior aspects of the squamosal suture. Rak ? noted that the squamosal suture of A. boisei is extensive, tapered with a bevel ?, and possesses numerous inter- digitations. L.338y-6 also has an extensive squamosal suture ?. KNM-WT 17000 has an extensive suture, though there is disagreement concerning its morphology. Rak & Kimbel ? consider the specimen to have a unique posterolateral extension of the suture, which is disputed by Walker et al. ?. We follow the latter in the interpretation of KNM-WT 17000. Squamosal suture morphology is poorly preserved in adult A. robustus, so that species cannot be characterized. All other species lack an extensive suture."';

Skelton & McHenry ? stated that mastoids in Homo are uninflated ?. Furthermore, A. africanus is here considered uninflated whereas they referred to this species as being variable. The mastoid of Sts 5 is medial to its crest, while those of Sts 71 and MLD 37/38 are level with their crests. Contra Olson ?, A. afarensis is considered to lack an inflated mastoid."';

Sherwood ? states that an antrum is absent in A. boisei, but Walker & Leakey ? observed extensive pneumatization in KNM-WT 17400. Consequently, A. boisei is considered variable. S&M 76 considered A. africanus to be weakly pneumatized."^n^nModifications made by Strait and Grine ?: ^n"Strait et al. ? noted that "facial hafting and the incursion of the temporal lines ? are related to the presence or absence of a frontal trigon," and that "therefore the latter is not considered an independent character." Consequently, the frontal trigon is not employed here. Asfaw et al. ? noted that a frontal trigon is present in A. garhi, and claimed that by omitting this character, we ? served to strengthen our "preferred conclusion of "robust australopithecine monophyly." However, because the three species of Paranthropus exhibit a frontal trigon, the exclusion of this feature could not possibly have strengthened the case for Paranthropus monophyly."';
	TEXT CHARACTER=28 TEXT='Description from Strait et al. ?: ^n"This character, as described by Tobias ? and Howell ?, expresses the position of the face relative to the neurocranium.

Furthermore, contra S&M 55, the morphology of P. robustus is probably better expressed in SK 47 than in SK 48. Although SK 47 is a juvenile, it is much older ontogenetically than AL 333-105.

There is slight overlap between taxa across the 58 mm boundary. Regardless, the principal point is that the distance is long in A. boisei and A. robustus, contrary to S&M 56. As reconstructed by Grine et al. ?, KNM-ER 1470 is on the boundary between long and short, but is considered long because other reconstructions ? would suggest a considerably greater distance.^nThis character was also measured as a ratio of the distance between the TMJ and M2/M3 relative to bi-foramen ovale breadth, and comparable results were obtained."';

In contrast, A. robustus, H. habilis and H. rudolfensis are here assigned to the intermediate category. H. ergaster is variable, because the fossa of KNM-ER 3883 is of intermediate depth while those of KNM-ER 3773 and KNM-WT 15000 are shallow. These taxa are usually all considered to have deep fossae, but index values do not support such state assignments. Furthermore, of all the species examined, only H. sapiens and A. boisei possess an articular eminence whose posterior face is so steeply inclined as to be nearly vertical. This undoubtedly accounts for the fact that they have larger index values than any other species. Wood ? states that H. habilis has a deeper fossa than H. rudolfensis, but we characterize both as intermediate. The discrepancy between our state assignments and those of others may rest in the fact that our measurement is one of relative depth. The fossae of A. robustus and early Homo may be as absolutely deep as in H. sapiens, but only those of A. boisei are relatively as deep. The fossae of A. boisei are absolutely the deepest and widest of any hominid."';

In the study by Strait et al. ?, the P3 occlusal outline was omitted as a character because it was judged to be a poor discriminator of hominid species. While the occlusal outline per se displays considerable intraspecific variability, the degree of asymmetry of the crown base appears to differentiate certain taxa ?. That is, the tuberculum premolare may be developed, resulting in a mesiobuccal protrusion of the crown base. This may result in an asymmetrical crown profile. The degree of symmetry, then, is scored as the mesiobuccal protrusion of the crown base being strong ?, moderate ?, variable ?, or weak to absent ?. Unlike the development of the transverse ridge, and the development and mesial enclosure of the fovea anterior, the development of the mesiobuccal flange ? of the P3 is not related directly to the size and disposition of the metaconid.^nBecause the degree of mesiobuccal protrusion of the P3 crown base serves to differentiate taxa, it has been added to the phylogenetic character matrix.

White et al. ? commented further that "the strong mesiobuccal protrusion of ARA-VP-6/ 1 crown base is also outside the known A. afarensis range,"but they noted that another specimen ? has a "weaker mesiobuccal protrusion of the crown base," which is similar to Pr. afarensis homologues. Ardipithecus ramidus is thus scored as being intermediate between Pan and Pr. afarensis in the asymmetry of its lower P3 crown.^nIn the description of A. anamensis, Leakey et al. ? observed that it can be differentiated from Pr. afarensis on the basis that its "[lower] third premolar is very asymmetrical with a blunt, centrally positioned main cusp," and because its P3 has an "extensive sloping" buccal surface. This species is, therefore, scored as being intermediate between Pan and Pr. afarensis in the asymmetry of its P3 crown.^nIn their diagnosis of A. garhi, Asfaw et al. ? noted that the upper P3 has a "more oval" occlusal outline, a derived state shared with Homo and A. africanus. They also observed that the "mesiobuccal line extension" is lacking.^nPraeanthropus afarensis is scored as variable in this feature on the basis of Leonard and Hegmon''s ? data and on observations of casts of all of the available ? premolars. For example, LH 4 has a moderate degree of mesiobuccal protrusion of its lower P3, whereas A.L. 333w-60 exhibits weak mesiobuccal protrusion; the A.L. 266- 1 P3 is intermediate between these two extremes."';
